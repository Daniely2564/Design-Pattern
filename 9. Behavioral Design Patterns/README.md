# Behavioral Design Patterns

Concerns the behavior of components. We will learn how to combine objects and how to define the way they communicate so that the behavior of the resulting structure becomes **extensible, modular, reusable, and adaptable**.

**Strategy Pattern**

- Helps us change parts of a component to adapt it to specific needs.

**State Pattern**

- Allows us to chnage the behavior of a component based on its state.

**Template Pattern**

- Allows us to reuse the structure of a component to define new ones.

**Iterator Pattern**

- Provides us with a common interface to iterate over a collection.

**Middleware Pattern**

- Allows us to define a modular chain of processing steps.

**Command pattern**

- Materializes the infromation required to execute a routine, allowing such information to be easily transferred, stored, and processed.
